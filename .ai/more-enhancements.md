More Enhancements

- It would be very  nice if a specific file could be added to a "save list", meaning you always want to skip deleting it.
- It would also be very nice to clean up the display UI... it's too cluttered
  - an fzf-style UI for selecting files to delete would be nice, instead of answering one-by-one
  - a tabular display of what is there and what its status is before deletion would also be great
  - more memorable menu options:
    - 0: don't delete anything
    - 1: go through them one-by-one
    - X: enter the number of files to delete if you want to delete everything
  - more color to highlight key information would be useful (using Sai, of course)
  - a running total of how much space you'll save the currently selected items for deletion
- Better handling of different network problems (1, below)





Other suggested features
------------------------

1. Remote File Not Accessible (Network/HTTP Error)
The remote URL is not accessible (e.g., 404, 500, timeout, DNS error).
UI should show a clear warning (e.g., ‚ö†Ô∏è or a message like "Remote file not accessible").

Test: Simulate accessible: false in the URL checker and verify output.

2. Multiple Download URLs with Mixed Results
A file has multiple download URLs, each with a different status (one matches, one differs, one is inaccessible).
UI should show per-URL indicators and not just for the first.

Test:  Provide a download_urls array with mixed comparison results and check all are displayed.


3. ETag Present but Malformed or Empty
ETag header is present but not a valid MD5 or is empty.
UI should clarify that the ETag is not usable for comparison.

Test:  Simulate ETag as "" or a non-MD5 string and check for üü° and explanation.

4. Last-Modified Present but Cannot Parse
Last-Modified header is present but in an invalid format.
UI should show a warning about parse failure.

Test:  Simulate a bad Last-Modified string and check for üü° and parse error message.

5. Local File Missing
The local file is missing (deleted or moved) but still listed.
UI should indicate it cannot compare or compute MD5/mtime.

Test:  Make file_exists? return false and check for warning or fallback behavior.


6. Future or Out-of-Sync Last-Modified
Last-Modified is in the future or far in the past compared to local mtime.
UI should warn about clock skew or suspicious timestamps.

Test:  Simulate a remote time far ahead/behind and check for warning.

7. Unusual Content Types
The content type is not a typical downloadable file (e.g., application/json, text/html).
UI should clarify that the remote resource may not be a direct file.

Test:  Simulate such content types and verify the type indicator and message.

8. Permission Errors
The app cannot read the local file (permission denied).
UI should show a warning about inability to compute MD5/mtime.

Test:  Simulate file_size or file_mtime raising Errno::EACCES and check for warning.

9. Redirects
The HEAD request returns a redirect (302) to another URL.
UI should indicate the redirect and, if possible, follow and show the final result.

Test:  Simulate a redirect chain and check that the UI shows the correct final status.
If you want, I can help you implement any (or all) of these scenarios in your test suite and/or UI logic! Let me know which ones are most important for your workflow.
